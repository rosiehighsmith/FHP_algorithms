These are files that include solutions to the Linked List challenges for the Firehose Project. As an example, to see q1 run in the console, call 'ruby q1build.rb'. 

- lib/linked_list_node.rb initializes the Linked List and creates a method to print the list
- lib/stack.rb is the code to create the stack data structure
- lib/q1.rb reverses linked list using a stack for question1
- lib/q2.rb reverses linked list without a stack for question2

In the top-level folder, these files implement the algorithms:
- q1build.rb
- q2build.rb
